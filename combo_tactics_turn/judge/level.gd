#
# AUTHORITATIVE level (judge side; overlaid over game/level.gd at judge time — the agent never sees
# this file). Builds one tactics battlefield purely from an RNG: a grid with walls, our squad
# (team 0) and enemy pieces (team 1). During our turn the enemies never move; they only strike back
# when hit and left alive.
#
# The controller drives our whole turn one action at a time; the world executes each action
# authoritatively and the board changes before the next decision, so a move can free or block a
# cell the next action needs. RNG is LOCKED (fixed damage, no misses) so the whole turn is exact.
#
# Scenarios are HAND-DESIGNED (TASK_AUTHORING §7): build() dispatches on the scenario name from
# task.yaml; the rng only perturbs values inside safe bands that never flip a kill, a reachability
# or a retaliation-lethality. The reserved `baseline` is the public twin of game/level.gd; every
# other scenario ARMS exactly one link (its `press` axis) while keeping the others in their baseline
# (defused) shape:
#   * "baseline"      : two frail lone enemies, each reachable and one-shot killable, budget ample,
#                       no ally in any path, no lethal retaliator. A plan built once at turn start
#                       and executed blindly coincidentally works. Bit-identical to game/level.gd.
#   * "kill_priority" : two 2-shot enemies but only enough budget to kill ONE — the squad must
#                       concentrate fire on a single target instead of splitting it (armed: value
#                       ordering under a scarce shared budget).
#   * "replan_path"   : the only free approach cell to a lone enemy also lies on a second unit's
#                       route; a plan snapshotted at turn start marches both units onto the same
#                       cell (armed: re-collect the board after each move).
#   * "suicide_guard" : a single tank enemy that cannot be killed this turn and whose retaliation
#                       one-shots our attacker — attacking it throws away a unit for nothing, so the
#                       correct turn attacks nobody (armed: do-not-feed / reserve when a kill is not
#                       securable).
#   * "livelock"      : a lone enemy fully sealed behind walls (never reachable, never attackable);
#                       a controller with no termination guard wanders forever (armed: bounded
#                       termination — the turn must end).
#   * "full_press"    : EVERY composed axis armed at once on one 10x6 board (the load-degradation
#                       "final exam" layered on the COMPLETED single-axis matrix).
#   * "solver_blowup" : ANTI-SOLVER deep tier (press kill_priority:focus_budget). The kill_priority
#                       trap is armed for real (a turn-start snapshot splits fire and secures zero),
#                       but the board is scaled up (18x12 open field, THREE of our units, three
#                       2-shot enemies) so that a controller which plans the whole turn by ONE-SHOT
#                       WHOLE-STATE-SPACE ENUMERATION (positions x hp x ap over all our units) blows
#                       past the 1g/120s container budget, while the per-step re-collect greedy
#                       (proper) stays polynomial and secures kill_min. The gap is a complexity-class
#                       wall, not a numeric band.

#   * replan_path arm  : the single-gap wall column at x=5 (gap (5,2)) funnels BOTH our units'
#     eastbound routes; enemy X's approach cell (6,2) is STRICTLY manhattan-nearest for both
#     units (its other free neighbours are 2+ farther), so a turn-start snapshot routes both

#   * kill_priority arm: TWO 2-shot enemies (X at (7,2), Y behind it at (9,2)) with team_ap 3 —
#     one hit each kills nobody; concentrating two hits kills exactly one. Both sit behind the
#     same funnel (the single-axis "equally reachable" geometry would need two doors; funnel

#     not geometry). Correct play never touches it.

#     adjacent-reachable; (9,4) is not adjacent to Y's stand cells, so it blocks no approach).
#     team_ap 3 (not 2) keeps this trap armed AFTER the kill: with 2, spending the budget on
#     the kill would hand every controller a coincidental "no AP -> end" exit; with 3 there is
#     1 AP left and the sealed enemy is one-shot "killable", so a controller with no

#     and the container OOM-kills it well before it can act. This is a COMPLEXITY-CLASS wall (the
#     one-shot enumerator is exponential in unit count), not a numeric band.
#   * kill_priority arm: three 2-shot enemies (hp 91..100) on separate lanes, each the manhattan-

#     enemy and swings once each -> three 50-dmg hits, zero kills (each needs two). kill_min = 1:
#     floor(3 AP / 2) = one 2-shot kill is the ceiling; the per-step greedy concentrates two hits on
#     its nearest enemy and secures exactly that (1 AP left), so the bound is tight AND achievable.
