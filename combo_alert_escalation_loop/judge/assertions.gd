# Black-box runtime observables for combo_alert_escalation_loop. They read only the WORLD's
# observable quantities (the guard's pose + cone, the intruder positions, wall colliders, event
# timing) and the controller's DECLARED intent (move + alert level) — never the controller's
# internals. judge.gd sequences them into the escalation-story verdict.
#
# THIS FILE IS JUDGE-ONLY. It holds the AUTHORITATIVE suspicion meter (the exact salience-weighted
# cross-frame integrator the world runs) and the judge-fixed verdict tolerances. It is deliberately
# NOT part of the shared sim_core twin and never overlaid into game/: the meter rule + the FSM
# contract are disclosed in prose (README.md) and the constants handed to the controller via state,
# but the reference stays here so a solution must build its own from the rule rather than call ours.
