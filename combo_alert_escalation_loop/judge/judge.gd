#
# Judge driver for combo_alert_escalation_loop — the graded-alert guard combo. Invoked headless,
# once per (scenario, seed) cell:
#
#   godot --headless --path <proj> res://judge.tscn -- \
#       --scenario <name> --seed N --press <axis:tier[,axis:tier]> \
#       --controller res://logic/controller.gd --out /abs/result.json
#
# (baseline carries only --scenario baseline; hidden cells add --press, harness-serialised from the
# task.yaml press mapping. The judge passes the raw string to Level.build, whose per-scenario
# dispatch expects the exact armed form — anything else returns {} and fail-fasts.)
#
# One full escalation story, asserted black-box. The guard watches from its post; ONE intruder rides
# a scripted polyline. Each frame the controller reports {"move": Vector2, "alert": int} (0 idle /
# 1 suspicious / 2 aggro). The judge maintains the AUTHORITATIVE suspicion meter (assertions, from
# the guard's CURRENT pose) and recomputes strict visibility + the geometric SEARCH obligation —
# PURELY from the guard's body geometry, never the controller's claims — and asserts every link.
# Every FAIL carries "broken_link":
#
#   broken_link = "suspicion_meter"  the AGGRO step is mistimed vs the reference meter reaching full:
#                                    premature (meter well short of full), late (lags the crossing),
#                                    missed (meter filled, never aggro'd), false (meter never filled,
#                                    aggro'd anyway). AMBIENT here — scored on every cell but armed by
#                                    no cell (atom_suspicion_meter is retired; the pure formula-copy
#                                    meter tiers were cut). Keeps the aggro step honest across cells.
#   broken_link = "search"           abandoned_search — the guard engaged a quarry, lost it to COVER
#                                    in range, then failed to advance to last_known (turned back /
#                                    stalled). combo_search_last_known's commitment axis.
#   broken_link = "escalation"       (this combo's graded-alert FSM; state-read axis, armed only when
#                                    COUPLED with the search cover-break) —
#                                    alert_thrash    : the declared alert chatters IDLE<->SUSPICIOUS
#                                                      across a boundary hover (no hysteresis);
#                                    relock_failed   : after the quarry re-emerges while the search is
#                                                      still open, the guard fails to re-declare AGGRO
#                                                      within RELOCK_TOL (it de-escalated on a timer
#                                                      instead of staying primed) — including the
#                                                      SECOND re-emergence of double_bait, where a
#                                                      guard that never re-armed its priming goes cold;
#                                    early_standdown : the guard declares IDLE while its geometric
#                                                      search obligation is still OPEN — a direct
#                                                      violation of the de-escalation conjunction gate
#                                                      (calm AND search-finished). Scored only where
#                                                      escalation:early_standdown is armed.
#   broken_link = "line_of_sight"    ghost_chase — the controller declares AGGRO on a strictly
#                                    invisible quarry (out of range or behind cover) beyond grace.
#   broken_link = "move_navigation"  clipping — the guard's body penetrates a wall.
#   broken_link = "engagement"       chase_too_loose — a declared AGGRO that never closes to
#                                    ENGAGE_DIST within grace, or drifts far beyond it after closing.
#   broken_link = "return"           return_failed — once fully quiet the guard does not get home.
#   broken_link = "completion"       timeout — the watch ends mid-story.
