extends RefCounted
#
# AUTHORITATIVE level for atom_plan_orchestrator (judge side).
# Overlaid over game/level.gd at judge time — the agent never sees this file.
#
# Scenarios are hand-designed; rng only perturbs values inside safe numeric bands that never cross a
# structural invariant (never flip solvability, and never flip the commit_early / commit_late A/B
# assignment). Every mutation surfaces through the SAME state channels the baseline uses (threat
# countdown, resource flags, action progress) — a per-tick re-checking orchestrator survives with no
# foreknowledge; a plan-once / memoryless / fixed-doctrine one breaks on its own axis.
#
#   "baseline"      : one active goal (keep_warm), no mutation, ample time, trivial precond ordering.
#   "resource_race" : mid-chop a wood delivery arrives (has_wood becomes true) AND the tree closes.
#                     A per-tick re-checker builds from the delivered wood; a plan-once executor
#                     keeps chopping a vanished tree -> stale_plan.
#   "priority_flip" : keep_fed's (observable) priority swings above/below keep_warm every few ticks.
#                     A committed orchestrator finishes its firepit; a memoryless argmax thrashes
#                     between the two peer goals, completing neither -> unjustified_switch.
#   "sealed_goal"   : the warmth chain is permanently sealed from t0 (no tree, no wood) while
#                     keep_warm stays a valid, high-priority goal. The orchestrator must fall through
#                     to the feasible keep_fed; a no-feasibility one commits impossible chops
#                     -> infeasible_commit.
#   "commit_early"  : a threat arrives EARLY in the firepit plan; remaining + flee > time_to_impact,
#                     so the plan cannot finish in time -> must bail and flee NOW. An always-finish
#                     doctrine is caught (commit_vs_bail).
#   "commit_late"   : a threat arrives LATE (firepit one tick from done, and lighting it is
#                     survival-critical); remaining + flee <= time_to_impact -> must finish then flee.
#                     An always-bail doctrine drops the firepit and later freezes (commit_vs_bail).
#
# spec keys (game twin must produce the SAME baseline key set):
#   warmth0, hunger0, wood_stock0, has_wood0, tree_available, food_available, cover_reachable,
#   flee_duration, threat0 (int time_to_impact or -1 = none), max_ticks
# Judge-only keys (consumed via spec.get(key, default); the game twin never emits them, so the
# baseline stays bit-identical):
#   spec["resource_events"] : Array of {"at": tick, "set": {key: value, ...}} applied AFTER that
#                             tick's action resolves (unforewarned mid-run resource mutation).
#   spec["threat_events"]   : Array of {"at": tick, "tti": int} — inject a threat with that countdown.
#   spec["fed_osc"]         : {"high": int, "on": int, "off": int, "start": tick} — swing keep_fed's
#                             priority bonus (observable in state.goals).
#   spec["sealed"]          : {"tree": bool, "food": bool} — marks a resource permanently sealed, so
#                             a fresh infeasible commit on it is tagged infeasible_commit (not the
#                             transient precondition_violation).
