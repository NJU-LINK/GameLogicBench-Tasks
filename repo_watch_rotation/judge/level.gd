#
# AUTHORITATIVE level (judge side; overlaid over game/level.gd at judge time — agent never sees this
# file). Builds the NIGHT-WATCH arena purely from an RNG, COMPOSED from calibrated lineages:
#   * per-post vision cone + suspicion salience    <- atom_suspicion_meter
#   * walls/nav + line-of-sight visibility          <- combo_search_last_known (its own atoms)
# Two guards share a fixed HEADCOUNT across two posts (A upper, C lower) that each watch a corridor
# to the right-edge RESTRICTED ZONE, plus an intermittent SEARCH obligation (a quarry B rounding
# mid-field cover). The scarce pool is the two guards: manning both posts leaves nobody to search, so
# a search must STEAL a guard off a post — affordable only when that post's suspicion fills slowly.
#
# Scenarios are HAND-DESIGNED structures (TASK_AUTHORING §7); build() dispatches on the scenario name
# and the rng only perturbs values inside safe numeric bands (waypoint offsets, walk speed, edge
# angle, quarry phase/period) that never change which scenario it is or whether/when the crunch
# happens. `press` (serialised from task.yaml) selects the armed tier(s); a press outside this task's
# vocabulary returns {} so the judge fail-fasts (never judge a guessed world).
#
#   baseline    : both posts gentle-or-benign, the quarry only lost by RANGE (no cover break) — a
#                 no-search, both-posts-manned guard is coincidentally correct. TWIN of game/level.gd.
#   slow_leak / close_rush / peek_flicker : arm suspicion_meter on post C (the atom's three naive
#                 exposure faces); search side benign; both guards man their posts.
#   corner_slip / deep_hide : arm search (the quarry slips behind mid-field cover in range); post C
#                 benign so a guard is free to rove; suspicion side gentle.
#   crunch_afford = {slow_leak, corner_slip} : post C fills SLOWLY (affordable) + a REAL quarry B to
#                 search — correct play PULLS guard C for the short search and returns before C fills.
#   crunch_deny   = {close_rush, deep_hide}  : post C fills FAST (unaffordable) + B is a DECOY that
#                 loops back — correct play HOLDS guard C on post; engaging B dooms post C.
