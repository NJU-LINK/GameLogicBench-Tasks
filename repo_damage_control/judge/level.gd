# AUTHORITATIVE level for repo_damage_control (judge side; overlaid over game/level.gd at judge
# time — the agent never sees this file). Builds one damage-control situation on a 1-D corridor ship
# purely from an RNG: a row of rooms (each with docking SLOTS + a CAPACITY + hazard readings
# o2/fire/breach), the DOORS joining them, the crew spawn positions, and a per-tick ORDER SCRIPT
# assigning crew to STATION rooms (may re-order mid-run). Movement, doors, fire and o2 are run
# authoritatively by the world; the controller decides which slot each crew heads for and which
# doors to seal.
#
# Scenarios are HAND-DESIGNED (TASK_AUTHORING §7): build() dispatches on the scenario name; the rng
# only perturbs values inside safe bands that never flip a capacity, a crossing, a door-timing
# outcome, or a graded hazard binary. The reserved `baseline` is the public twin of game/level.gd;
# every other scenario ARMS exactly one axis (its `press`) while keeping the others in baseline
# (defused) shape — EXCEPT the coupled cell `damage_control` (two axes armed). See per-scenario docs.
#
# The world is a shared 5-bay grid (rooms are placed on bays 0..k as room ids 0..k; slot global id
# for bay b slot j is 3*b+j). All scenarios share W×H so the preview/record window is fixed.
