#
# AUTHORITATIVE level (judge side; overlaid over game/level.gd at judge time — the agent never sees
# this file). Builds one autobattler-economy campaign purely from an RNG: the opening purse, the flat
# base income, the starting field cap (level), the watch deadline, the enemy threat waves (arrival /
# duration / power / target front) and the purchasable catalog (per-front cards, xp, and a bond).
# Returns a spec dict.
#
# Scenarios are HAND-DESIGNED (TASK_AUTHORING §7): build() dispatches on the scenario name from
# task.yaml; the rng only perturbs numbers inside safe bands chosen so the pivotal quantities never
# flip (whether saving is worth it, whether the field cap must be raised, the fund-by gaps that decide
# who is standing in time). The reserved `baseline` is the public twin of game/level.gd; the other
# scenarios ARM one or both pressure axes:
#
#   * interest (alloc-original, the novel wall) — WHETHER the shared purse should first SAVE (buy a
#     bond, whose return compounds if reinvested) before it buys combat power, or spend now. Two tiers
#     press the same save-vs-spend arithmetic from opposite ends, so a fixed doctrine breaks on one:
#       - "slow_burn"  : a distant, EXPENSIVE front. The flat income never affords its force; only
#                        saving early (bonds -> returns -> reinvest) grows the purse enough in time. A
#                        spend-now book that never saves can never afford the force and the front falls.
#       - "early_rush" : an EARLY front (arrival PINNED). The opening purse is exactly the war chest to
#                        buy power NOW. An econ-first book that banks the opening chest in bonds locks
#                        it in immature deposits and the front falls before they mature; spending now
#                        survives. (Same axis as slow_burn, flipped end.)
#   * leverage (alloc-original) — WHETHER the shared purse must raise the FIELD CAP (buy xp) so a front
#     can field enough units, or just buy cards. "heavy_front": a front whose wave needs MORE units
#     than the starting cap allows — a cards-only book buys cards that sit benched over the cap and
#     fields too little; buying xp first (raise the cap) then cards survives. Gentle purse/timing so
#     ONLY the cap gate is tested (interest defused).
#   * "full_ledger" (COUPLED: interest slow_burn x leverage heavy_front): a distant expensive front
#     (f1 — interest, a spend-now book never affords it) and an early cap-gated front (f2 — leverage, a
#     cards-only book never fields enough). The whole discipline must hold: save for f1 AND raise the
#     cap for f2. Attribution is by WHICH front fell (its judge-only `axis` tag): f1 -> interest;
#     f2 -> leverage.
#
# spec keys (the game twin must produce the same key set MINUS the judge-only extras):
#   gold0       : opening purse
#   base_income : flat gold per tick
#   level0      : starting field cap (units a front may field)
#   deadline    : the watch ends at this tick
#   fronts      : Array of {id, hp, axis}      (axis is JUDGE-ONLY attribution)
#   waves       : Array of {arrival, duration, power, target}
#   catalog     : Array of {id, system(card|xp|bond), cost, build, target, value}
