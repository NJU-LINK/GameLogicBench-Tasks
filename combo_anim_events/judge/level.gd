# AUTHORITATIVE level (judge side; overlaid over game/level.gd at judge time -- the agent never sees
# this file). build() dispatches on the scenario name from task.yaml; the reserved `baseline` is the
# bit-identical twin of game/level.gd, and each hidden scenario ARMS one pressure axis. The rng only
# perturbs a NON-PIVOTAL number (trailing padding advances) inside a safe band; the timeline STRUCTURE
# of every scenario (which animations play, their frame-event tables, the dt / seek / speed / play
# steps) is FIXED, because the axes are structural -- low-fps multi-cross / mid-run speed change /
# seek-skip / interrupt -- not numeric.
#
# The world is a REAL AnimationPlayer (see sim_core.gd) used as the authoritative CLOCK: the driver
# calls ap.advance(dt) / ap.seek(t) / sets ap.speed_scale / ap.play(other) on it, and the delivered
# dispatcher module reads ap.current_animation + ap.current_animation_position each frame. Frame
# events (guard_drop / strike / recover / stumble) live in a disclosed contract table, NOT as method
# tracks -- the module must map them onto the engine clock per the disclosed contract (advance fires
# every key crossed, in ascending time order, matching engine method tracks; a seek fires NONE of the
# keys -- a deliberate strengthening of the engine's native seek, which fires the nearest preceding key).
#
# spec keys (the game twin produces the same set MINUS the judge-only `armed`/hidden scenarios):
#   anims      : { anim_name -> {length:float, loop:bool} }
#   events     : { anim_name -> [ {time:float, id:String}, ... ] (sorted ascending by time) }
#   start_anim : the animation played at t=0
#   steps      : Array of {do:advance|seek|speed|play, ...}   (see generator_api.gd)
#   armed      : the pressure axis this scenario arms (judge-only attribution tag; "" for baseline)

# --- PUBLIC baseline (bit-identical twin of game/level.gd) --------------------------------------
# One jab at normal frame rate (one physics frame == one animation frame == dt 1/60). Exactly one
# frame-event crosses per frame; a dispatcher that just counts its own frames from 0 tracks it by
# coincidence. `pad` (safe band) only lengthens the tail after the last event.

	return _shell(BASELINE, "", "", "jab", steps)


# NOTE (engine fact, verified in the spike): when a NON-loop animation reaches its length the engine
# clamps the clock and CLEARS current_animation to "". A position-reading dispatcher would then miss
# an event crossed on that clamping frame. To keep the observable equal to the literal contract
# (every crossed event fires), every scenario keeps the clock STRICTLY inside the animation length
# through its last event -- the animation stays playing and named the whole way.

# --- HIDDEN: bigstep / multi_cross (R1) ---------------------------------------------------------
# LOW FRAME RATE: the first physics frame advances the clock 0.6s, so a SINGLE frame spans two frame
# events (guard_drop@0.2 AND strike@0.5) that must fire this frame in ascending time order; the next
# frame (0.6 -> 0.95) carries recover@0.8. A dispatcher that keys events off its own per-frame
# counter (assuming 60 fps) never reaches those frame numbers and fires nothing.

# --- HIDDEN: speed / runtime_scale (R1) ---------------------------------------------------------
# A mid-run speed_scale = 2.0 makes the clock advance twice as fast per frame, so every frame event
# lands at HALF the frame index (guard_drop at f6, strike at f15, recover at f24). A dispatcher
# reading the real clock re-aligns automatically; one that counts frames at a fixed 60 fps fires each
# event at the wrong (unscaled) frame. 27 frames reach pos 0.9 (inside jab).

# --- HIDDEN: seek / skip_ahead (R4) -------------------------------------------------------------
# After guard_drop fires, the game SEEKS the clock forward from 0.2 to 0.7, jumping over strike@0.5.
# Contract (the game's own rule -- stricter than engine-native seek, which fires the nearest
# preceding key; both verified empirically): a seek does
# NOT fire the events it skips -- strike is discarded. recover@0.8 still fires on the resumed play.
# A dispatcher that ignores the seek keeps counting and fires strike (a skipped event) later, or a
# frame-counter dispatcher drifts off the sought clock entirely. 12 frames after the seek reach 0.9.
static func _seek_resync(_rng: RandomNumberGenerator) -> Dictionary:
	var dt := _dt()
	var steps: Array = _n_advance(12, dt)          # 0 -> 0.2 : guard_drop fires
	steps.append({"do": "seek", "to": 0.7})        # jump over strike@0.5 (discarded)
	steps.append_array(_n_advance(12, dt))         # 0.7 -> 0.9 : recover@0.8 fires (inside jab)
	return _shell("seek_resync", "seek", PRESS_SEEK, "jab", steps)


# --- HIDDEN: interrupt / cancel_pending (R4) ----------------------------------------------------
# Mid-jab (after guard_drop, before strike) the game INTERRUPTS by playing `stagger` (a real
# ap.play(), which resets the clock to 0 and switches current_animation). The jab's un-fired events
# (strike, recover) are cancelled; the stagger dispatches its own stumble@0.3 fresh. A dispatcher
# that does not notice the animation switch keeps its jab timeline running and mis-fires. 24 stagger
# frames reach pos 0.4 (inside stagger, length 0.6).
static func _state_cut(_rng: RandomNumberGenerator) -> Dictionary:
	var dt := _dt()
	var steps: Array = _n_advance(12, dt)          # jab 0 -> 0.2 : guard_drop fires
	steps.append({"do": "play", "anim": "stagger"})  # interrupt -> clock resets, current_anim=stagger
